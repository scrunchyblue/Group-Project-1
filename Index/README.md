Village -
It takes a village.
Village is a social networking service that’s dedicated to helping the elderly. On this neighorhood hub, you can make trusted connections. People in need can make a request for different types of services, find helpful information, and communicate with volunteers around their area. Join our village!
**
On the website’s landing page - you select one of two buttons:
- REQUEST: If you are here to make a service request, you select REQUEST. You will be taken to a form. Complete the form and your request will be added to our village bulletin board. A volunteer will be able to see your request and will have the opportunity to select and contact you.
- VOLUNTEER: If you are coming to the app as a volunteer, you click VOLUNTEER on the landing page. You will be taken directly to the main page. There, you can add your location onto the search input and be able to see requests around that specific area. You will also be able to see all recent requests on our village bulletin board.
